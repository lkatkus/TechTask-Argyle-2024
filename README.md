## Project setup
* `vitejs` - for easy react and typescript template;
* `tailwind css` - wanted to try something new as previously main experience was with `styled-compoents`;
* `react-query` - seemed like a very good fit;
* `react-hook-form` - works well without much boiler plate;
* `vitest` and `react-testing-library` - for basic testing unit and component tests;

## TODOS
* Add E2E test using `cypress` or similar;
* Add `storybook` for `component` development or even move the to an external library;
* Add some for fancy filtering for users, posts and comments;
* Separate pages for users and their posts;
* Proper designs;
